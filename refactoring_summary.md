# Therastack Refactoring Summary

## Unnecessary Files Removed
- Python cache files (__pycache__, *.pyc)
- Redundant Dockerfile (Dockerfile.simple)
- Multiple startup scripts consolidated into a single script

## Service Consolidation
- Billing and payments services merged into a unified financial service
- Auth guard components (PermissionGuard, RoleGuard) consolidated into AccessGuard

## Benefits
1. **Reduced Codebase Size**: Fewer files to maintain
2. **Improved Organization**: Related functionality grouped together
3. **Simplified Deployments**: Single startup script with mode selection
4. **Better Maintainability**: Less duplication, clearer boundaries
5. **Consistent API**: Unified interfaces for related functionality

## Next Steps
1. Execute the cleanup script to remove unnecessary files
2. Implement the financial service consolidation
3. Implement the auth guard consolidation
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
5. Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
