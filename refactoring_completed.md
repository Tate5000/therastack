# Therastack Refactoring - Completed

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Files
- Python cache files (__pycache__, *.pyc)
- Redundant Dockerfile (Dockerfile.simple)
- Multiple startup scripts consolidated into a single script

### 2. Service Consolidation
- **Financial Service**: Merged billing and payments services into a unified financial service
  - `/backend/services/financial/financial_api.py`
  - Unified models, sample data, and API endpoints
  - Maintained all functionality while reducing code duplication
  
- **Auth Components**: Consolidated PermissionGuard and RoleGuard into AccessGuard
  - `/frontend/components/auth/AccessGuard.tsx`
  - Created a more flexible component that can check both roles and permissions
  - Added barrel file (index.ts) for cleaner imports

### 3. Benefits Achieved
- **Reduced Codebase Size**: Fewer files to maintain
- **Improved Organization**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Simplified Deployments**: Single startup script with mode selection
- **Better Maintainability**: Less duplication, clearer boundaries
- **Consistent API**: Unified interfaces for related functionality

### 4. Remaining Improvements to Consider
- Review other services for potential consolidation
- Update unit tests to reflect the new structure
- Update documentation to reflect the new structure
- Consider implementing dependency injection for easier testing
